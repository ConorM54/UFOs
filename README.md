# UFOs
##OOP Assignment 1
The dataset which I have chosen for my project contains information on "UFOs" reported to National UFO Reporting Centre in California, USA.
This information includes: the date and time of the UFO sighting, the city in California which the sighting took place, the shape of the UFO seen, the duration of the UFO sighting.
The program displays a Menu from which various graphs can be selected. 
The first two graphs are scatter plot graphs of the duration the UFO was reportedly seen. I seperated the results into UFOs seen for less than a minute and greater than one minute. 
I did this as the duration range of the total number of reports was simply to large to graph and observe any patterns or correlation. The average time the UFO was seen is displayed
with red line cutting across the graph. The third graph is bar chart of the various descriptions given of what the UFO was shaped like. It was apparent that some shapes kept reappearing
so I decided to use a bar chart to represent the data. When the user hovers the mouse over one the bars in the bar chart the details relating that bar are displayed above.
For the final graph I spilt the total duration range into six seperate sub-ranges andcompared the frequency of each range using a
doughnut-chart. I have implmented that so when user moves the mouse withen range of a certain segemement of the doughnut the details relating to that segements are displayed .
